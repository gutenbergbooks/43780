<h2>THE LETTSOMIAN LECTURES</h2>

<p class="center">1900-1901</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LECTURE I.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President and Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;My first duty this evening
is to thank you, which I do most heartily and gratefully, for the
honour you have done me by selecting me to deliver the Lettsomian
Lectures for the present year. My second duty is to spend as
little time as possible on preliminary remarks, for&mdash;as you, Sir,
know, having yourself occupied this distinguished place on a former
occasion&mdash;three hours are all too brief for useful presentation of
material which one has collected for a purpose like the present. In
selecting the subject of my Lectures I was mindful of the character
and objects of this Society. In the Medical Society of London
there is a fuller blending of men engaged in family practice with
men holding hospital appointments than is the case at most of the
other learned societies connected with our profession in London;
and there is here an opportunity for free communication of experience
and interchange of opinion between these two classes of our
Fellows which cannot fail to be profitable to both. Therefore, I
have taken up a subject of thoroughly practical interest; and not
only this, but I will attempt to present it to you, to put you in a
position to look at it, from the point of view of the practitioner.
The problem of the diseases and disorders of the heart and arteries
in middle and advanced life may be said to come before the family
practitioner every hour of his work, and to offer difficulties and
create a sense of responsibility or even anxiety which are not
sufficiently appreciated by the hospital physician. There comes
before him the case of one of his patients, an active business man
of 45, who has been seized with angina pectoris when hurrying
to the station after breakfast, or that of an old friend, whose
proposal for an increase of his insurance at 50 has been declined
because of arterial degeneration and polyuria; or he is asked to
say whether a man of 60, occupying an important and possibly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
distinguished position in the community, ought to retire from
public life because he has occasional attacks of præcordial oppression
and a systolic murmur at the base of his heart. What, again,
is he to do for the stout, free-living man, just passing the meridian
of life, who consults him for weakness and depression, whose heart
is large and feeble, and the urine saccharine and slightly albuminous?
There is not one of my audience who has not met with such cases
as these many times in his practice, and a variety of other cases of
cardiac disorder and disease after 40, where the importance of the
individuals, the value of their lives, and the gravity of their complaints
and their prospects have exercised him very anxiously.
What is the prognosis in cases of this order? What can be done
for them in the way of treatment? These are the questions which
we would desire to answer usefully. The answer, it seems to me,
can be given only after an analysis and study of a considerable
number of instances of the kind, in respect of their origin, their
clinical characters and course, and the result. This is the method
of inquiry which I propose to follow. It will be a study of cardio-vascular
disease in older subjects from the clinical point of view,
and it will be approached not only from the ordinary clinical side
as it is approached in hospitals, that is, by an investigation of symptoms
and signs, but also and especially in the light of that particular
order of knowledge which the family practitioner has learned to
appreciate and has so intimate an opportunity to acquire correctly&mdash;a
knowledge of the origin or causes of the different affections, which
it is always difficult, and often impossible, for the hospital physician
to ascertain. For the same reason, although, to be complete, a
study of the diseases of the circulation at and after middle life
should include an account of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post-mortem</i> characters found in
fatal cases, and whilst the basis of the account I submit to you
will be essentially pathological, I shall not attempt to describe the
pathological anatomy and histology of this group of lesions of the
heart and arteries. This part of the subject has been remarkably
advanced during the last few years; and even if I had the time
and the necessary knowledge to deal with it now, I should have
nothing original in it to lay before you. Indeed, if I may venture
to say so, our attention lately has been too much confined to the
pathological states of the heart and arteries and too little directed
to the causes which produce them. "Arterial sclerosis" is now an
ordinary diagnosis in every-day practice, as if it were sufficient for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
purposes of prognosis and treatment to have determined that the
radial artery is thicker and longer and more dense than normal,
without regard to the actual nature of the pathological change,
whether strain, or syphilitic, or gouty, or otherwise. And in the
same way the phrase "dilatation of the heart" is now in everybody's
mouth, irrespective of considerations of its origin. Not only
has the profession suddenly woke up to the recognition of a form of
enlargement of the heart which was fully described fifty years ago by
physicians in our own country, but the public have made "dilated
heart" a fashionable disease which calls for the advice of a specialist
and an annual visit to a Continental spa. We ought to have
advanced beyond this stage of cardiac pathology long before this
time. Besides, of how much greater interest is it in our every-day
work to study the causes or circumstances that lead up to disease
than the simple state of disease itself! And there is in a study of
this kind an opportunity afforded to the family practitioner of
advancing Medicine&mdash;scientific, preventive and therapeutical&mdash;as
surely as if he were a pathologist in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post-mortem</i> room or
laboratory.</p>

<p>Before, however, examining the influences and circumstances
which disorder and damage the circulation in middle and advanced
life, let us see what the normal or natural state of the heart and
arteries is after 40. It has been ascertained that the different
parts of the circulatory apparatus pass through certain definite
phases of change in the different stages of that decline of existence
and energy which leads to senility and ends in death. We have
to thank Professor Beneke, of Marburg, for the results of a laborious
investigation of this subject which are generally accepted and which
I will attempt to summarise.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>We should all expect the cardio-vascular system to undergo
important changes with increasing age; but few of us would be
prepared to find that these changes are neither uniformly progressive
nor indeed continuously progressive in the same direction.
To make more easily intelligible the nature and as far as possible
the origin of these anatomical alterations in the heart and arteries
during the second half of life, I will first refer for a moment to
the circulation from 20 to 45. During this period of life the
blood-pressure is relatively high, reaching its maximum about 36;
the aorta and other large arteries increase in diameter from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
stress of the blood-pressure on their elastic walls, particularly
between 35 and 45, and the heart increases in size year after
year at a nearly uniform rate. We have in these facts anatomical
evidence of the great functional vigour and activity of the circulation
in manhood. At 45, which is practically the commencement
of the period with which we are concerned, remarkable changes
occur. Whilst the arteries continue to increase in circumference
(somewhat more slowly than before), the blood-pressure falls and
the heart begins&mdash;almost suddenly&mdash;to diminish in size; and these
three features characterise the circulation for the next 20 years,
that is, until the age of 65. How is this fall in the size of the heart
to be accounted for? Partly by the widening of the arterial trunks
and the consequent fall of pressure. But not by these only; for
although the arteries had been widening even more rapidly between
20 and 45, the pressure was actually at its maximum then and the
heart large, and we shall presently find other facts opposed to this
view. The peripheral resistance in the systemic arteries must fall
from some other cause or causes in middle age than the loss of
elasticity of the arterial walls, and these causes are probably reduction
of mechanical stress, due to comparative bodily relaxation,
loss of vaso-motor tone in the splanchnic area, and the chronic
diseases of which the subjects have died whose hearts and vessels
are measured <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post mortem</i>. During this phase of life also, the blood
becomes more venous in quality and its hæmoglobin value is
lowered.</p>

<p>At 65, other changes which occur in the heart and arteries are
not less striking than those which I have just described. The
decline of circulatory energy, and the effects of time itself on the
protoplasm of the cells of the body, have so lowered the metabolic
and functional energy of the tissues and organs and the activity of
the blood-supply, that a considerable proportion of the capillary network
becomes obsolete. The peripheral resistance is thus increased,
and the blood-pressure rises; therefore the heart once more increases
so much in size that at the end of the 10 years (age 75) it is found
as large as it was at 45, and at the same time the hæmoglobin
value of the blood again proves to be higher. During this period,
also, the arteries continue to grow wider and thicker and longer&mdash;another
proof that the size of the heart is not determined solely
by their calibre. Regarded as a whole, the process of senescence
of the cardio-vascular system presents to us a beautiful instance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
anatomical readjustment and compensation&mdash;the counterpart, in a
way, of the growth of the circulation in energy and activity during
the period of full manhood. The arterial walls, which have been
stretched in their diameter and in their length by exhaustion of
their elasticity under the stress of cardiac systole, are strengthened
afresh by the development of stays formed of fibroid and muscular
tissues in the intima and media; and the heart responds to the
altered mechanical condition ahead of it in the arteries, and to the
increased peripheral resistance caused by the obsolescence of many
capillaries, by growing afresh.</p>

<p>This account relates to the size of the arteries after 40; now let
us inquire what is the condition of their structural elements. The
changes described do not necessarily involve disease of the tissue
elements, unless we were to call every senile change morbid. My
friends Dr. Bosanquet and Dr. Mullings have given me an account
of the state of the heart and aorta in the bodies of 25 men, aged 40
and upwards, examined in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post-mortem</i> room of Charing Cross
Hospital, who had died from accident or suicide. The average age
was 53½ years, and the aorta presented some degree of atheroma in
half the cases. When we consider how very slight a change in the
arch of the aorta is habitually described as "atheroma," and that in
a few of the cases the valves were diseased and the heart enlarged,
we are justified in concluding that in the majority of persons of 53
the arteries are still sound. This result is in accord with that
obtained by the late Professor Humphry, who devoted his attention
so long and so successfully to the investigation of old age. He
states that in the great majority of cases the arterial system appears
to present a healthy condition in those who attain to great age.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
Even among the majority of centenarians the evidences of arterial
degeneration were not manifest.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> And we know that we occasionally
meet with people of 80 and upwards whose pulses are unexceptionable,
beyond presenting a trace of thickening and enlargement.</p>

<p>For my present purpose, therefore, we may conclude that as age
advances, the arteries naturally become wider, longer and thicker,
and altogether larger than in early life; and that we must not speak
of "vascular degeneration" in an evil sense as often as we find
these conditions present. As for the heart, we know that it may
remain structurally sound, and is more often regular than irregular,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
to the most advanced years of life. Conversely, these facts suggest
that actual diseases of the arteries and heart, that is, other than the
changes which are found in all persons after 45, are not properly
senile in their nature. As Professor Humphry said, they are no
part of, but are rather to be regarded as deviations from, or morbid
departures from, the natural phenomena.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> They must be the effects
of pathological processes due to a variety of pathogenetic influences
which assail the circulation. Now we are in a position to study these.</p>

<p>After the age of 40, many of the influences that threaten
the heart and arteries with disorder and disease are peculiar to
this period of life&mdash;that is, different and distinct from the causes
of cardiac and vascular affections in childhood, adolescence and
manhood; others of them have been encountered already, with or
without permanent damage as the result. I will now examine
them in detail, and at the same time refer to certain provisions with
which the heart and arteries are endowed for resisting them and
recovering naturally from their effects, as well as to the circumstances
which render these provisions abortive or insufficient, and
thus predispose to disease or indirectly determine its occurrence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>1. <em>Physical stress</em> is still a definite cause of cardiac and vascular
damage during the second half of life, in the forms both of sudden
violent exertion and of ordinary laborious occupations. I have met
with instances of acute and serious strain at all ages over 40, up to
and even after 70. I am aware that I must speak on this part
of my subject&mdash;the evil effects of muscular exercise&mdash;with great
caution in the presence of you, Sir, our President, who have long
been recognised as one of the principal patrons in our profession
of athletic sports, and so highly distinguished yourself in them at
Oxford and in the inter-University contests. I assume that you
are unwilling to admit that muscular exercise is dangerous to health.
But I feel sure that you will agree with me that when the man of
65 rushes from his breakfast-table to catch his train, or the lady
of 70 hurries up a hill in Wales to be in time for morning service,
or the middle-aged father on holiday, who has just started a bicycle
in order to reduce his weight, takes the pace from his son of 17, the
effect on the heart and arteries is likely to be serious. I have notes
of a good many cases of cardiac strain in middle-aged and old
persons from cycling; a very few from violent efforts to drive at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
golf; a few from efforts at lifting or resisting heavy weights; and
one notable case in which a member of our own profession, a man
of 45, belonging to the Royal Army Medical Corps, broke down with
acute cardiac dilatation during General French's memorable ride to
relieve Kimberley. In some of my cases there was no reason to
believe that the heart was other than sound before the strain; but
in a majority of them (and I have analysed 40, of which I have
more or less full notes) one or more of the safeguards of the
circulation against strain were already defective or wanting. What
are these? In the heart, chiefly a high degree of extensibility or
elasticity of its tissues, permitting over-distension of the chambers,
with safety-valve action of the tricuspid in extreme cases, and a
sound and vigorous musculature to effect the increased action, and
if necessary the hypertrophy, which mechanical stress demands&mdash;in
a word, healthy, well-nourished cardiac walls. It is an interesting
fact that two-thirds of my cases of cardiac strain in the second half
of life presented also a history of gout, fully developed or irregular&mdash;in
other words, a history of perverted metabolism. Equally striking
is another fact in this connection: that in many cases the occurrence
of strain in middle or advanced age was but the latest of a series
of similar events as the result of muscular effort for a period of
10, 20, 30, 40, or even 50 years&mdash;in other words, the heart had
been strained originally in youth or early manhood, and had given
serious trouble as often as it was taxed again. Rowing or running
at college was in a good many instances given as the cause of the
first strain. I need not do more than mention previous valvular
disease, usually of rheumatic origin, as a condition powerfully predisposing
to cardiac injury by physical exertion. Excepting in this
indirect way, rheumatism has no effect in lowering the resistance of
heart or vessels to mechanical stress.</p>

<p>The principal safeguard which the arteries possess against strain
is, of course, the extensibility and elasticity of their tissues. Unfortunately
the metabolic disorders, including gout, which we have just
found weakening the cardiac walls, are amongst the commonest
causes of arterial degeneration also; and the two influences&mdash;gout
and strain&mdash;acting together no doubt are accountable for a considerable
number of cases of atheroma and chronic arteritis. It naturally
might occur to us that gout and exertion could not well be associated,
but this very consideration serves to explain their mutual influence
in straining the heart. It is unwise, ill-timed, ill-planned muscular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
exercise that injures the circulation, most often on the part of the
middle-aged man, who, awaking to the consciousness of growing fat
and gouty, rushes inconsiderately to violent exercise for relief.</p>

<p>2. It is generally recognised that nervous excitement and other
<em>nervous influences</em> tax the circulation; and endless phrases and
expressions, articulate and inarticulate, testify to the universal
belief in the close connection between the heart and the emotions.
Quite recently Dr. Leonard Hill and Dr. George Oliver have
demonstrated instrumentally the rise of blood-pressure that accompanies
cerebral activity.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> No doubt many cases of disorder and
disease of the walls of the heart and arteries originate in distress,
worry, anxiety and protracted suspense; and the connection is most
often seen in middle and advanced life, because these depressing
emotions fall most heavily upon mankind at this period. Of the
instances which I have met with I will mention but one or two
by way of illustration. A member of the Reform Committee at
Johannesburg at the time of the Jameson Raid, who had been
confined in Pretoria Jail, came home sometime afterwards with
the ordinary symptoms and signs of fatty degeneration of the heart,
and died suddenly on the street. A detective officer who had
tracked suspects and criminals all over the world, facing great
personal danger, and on one occasion had to convey a parcel of
dynamite found near a Government office to a place of safety many
miles away, came under my care later on with arterial sclerosis and
cerebral thrombosis, for which no other cause but a life of adventure
could be discovered. These were cases of actual disease of the
heart and arterial system respectively; and I need not add that
disturbances or disorders of the circulation, of every degree and
variety, the result of nervous excitement or depression, come constantly
under our observation, especially in women. I would
particularly mention, however, a group of cardio-vascular troubles
that lie between these two extremes. I have frequently observed
that persons of anxious and energetic temperament, burthened with
responsible work of a heavy, constant and prolonged character,
when they break down, as they often do, present the clinical features
of high tension: the pulse is full, the heart is large, the second
aortic sound is loud and ringing; there is polyuria, and a trace
of albumen may be found. This disturbance of the circulation,
strongly suggestive of contracted kidney, is as common in women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
as in men&mdash;for instance, in matrons of schools or hospitals. Nevertheless,
however clear the direct connection between nervous strain
and cardio-vascular disease may be in many instances, it is in other
instances unreal, or more correctly indirect only. This is a matter
of great practical importance. First, the nervous temperament
often drives the subjects of it to physical overwork in the form
of incessant and prolonged devotion to work, with insufficient
hours of rest and sleep, and to unwise attempts to remove nervous
exhaustion by violent muscular exercise, as we have just seen. In
the second place, alcohol undoubtedly plays an important part in
many instances regarded as overwork and worry and nervous
exhaustion, both in men and in women&mdash;alcohol taken to enable
more work to be accomplished, to steady the nerves, to promote
sleep, to drive away care, or to relieve the faintness which it has
itself induced. And thirdly, many of the complaints of nervous
depression, lowness and worry are really due to gout, to influenza,
and the like, which are at the same time the true causes of the
cardiac symptoms.</p>

<p>3. What I have just said in connection with nervous causes of
cardio-vascular affections brings us naturally to that important
group of agents which may be summarily called <em>extrinsic cardiac
poisons</em>&mdash;alcohol, tobacco, tea, coffee and lead. I will not dwell on
this subject at present, for there is no need to prove the reality of
the connection, and I shall have occasion to refer to some of these
poisons at greater length under the head of diagnosis. Alcoholic
heart occurs both in men and women; tobacco heart is extraordinarily
common in our own profession, and common in clergymen
and in retired members of the public services; tea-, coffee-, and
cocoa- poisoning I have met with principally in students.</p>

<p>4. There can be no question but that by far the most prolific
causes of cardio-vascular disorder and disease after 40 are <em>disturbances
of metabolism</em>, including gout&mdash;at any rate amongst the middle
and upper classes in this country. This period of life brings with
it in many instances comparative relaxation from work, and a
disposition to substitute quiet or even passive for active exercise;
and whilst the demands of growth and development on the alimentary
system have greatly declined, the pleasures of the table and
ease generally are too often indulged in as a privilege of advancing
years and the legitimate reward of previous years of work. The
results are functional disorders of the liver, gout in regular and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
irregular forms, gravel, and the many associated disorders of the
muscular, nervous and other systems. At the same time the arterial
tension rises, for the body possesses a physiological provision
for eliminating the nitrogenous products of metabolism, whether
normal or abnormal, namely, the kidneys, the vaso-motor mechanism
and the heart. Stimulation of the vaso-motor centre by nitrogenous
waste raises the arterial pressure; the heart is excited to more
vigorous contraction (if necessary it hypertrophies); and the consequent
polyuria washes the intrinsic poisons out of the system.
Thus it happens that in metabolic disorders, from excessive or
unwholesome eating and drinking, the heart, vessels and kidneys
are kept under incessant strain; and, like other organs working
under strain in the gouty subject, they are the readiest to suffer&mdash;first
from disorders of many kinds, and ultimately, unless reform
be enforced, from cardio-vascular degeneration and chronic Bright's
disease.</p>

<p>Of the many cases of this kind that I have seen at all ages
between 40 and 80 (and others before 40), the proportion of
irregular gout to acute articular gout was about 3 to 2. Under
irregular gout I include goutiness in its many forms&mdash;sick headache,
eczema, sciatica, lumbago, acid dyspepsia, irritable bladder, asthma,
insomnia, vertigo, depression, and the familiar complexion and
appearance generally of "the gouty individual," all variously
combined.</p>

<p>In other cases the metabolic disturbances come before us not
as gout or even goutiness in the ordinary acceptation of the term,
but in the forms of obesity, of diabetes, of gravel, of irregular
albuminuria, and of the effects of large eating and free living in
general.</p>

<p>5. <em>Syphilis</em>&mdash;that fruitful cause of vascular disease, and both
directly and indirectly of cardiac disease&mdash;has by no means ceased
to attack the organs of circulation after 40. Whatever the date of
the primary infection, syphilis is a standing danger to the heart and
arteries in the middle-aged man and even in declining years. Thus,
in 11 cases belonging to this group, the average age at which they
came under my observation (most of them but not all complaining
of cardiac distress) was 55. All of these were men. I ought to add
that in a considerable proportion of the cases either physical strain,
alcohol, tobacco or Bright's disease was associated with syphilis in
the etiology, and sometimes more than one of these.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>6. For the man and woman of forty years of age and upwards,
most of <em>the acute specific fevers</em> are affairs of the past. But the
liability to several of them remains, and, very unfortunately, the
liability to those acute specific processes which may attack the
cardio-vascular system&mdash;influenza in particular, and less often
typhoid fever, rheumatism, diphtheria and pneumonia, as well as
septicæmia of different forms or kinds, which works havoc throughout
the entire circulation. I should have had more to say under
this head but for the fact that our distinguished Fellow and former
President, Dr. Sansom, has thoroughly investigated it, and on more
than one occasion laid the results before you.</p>

<p>7. I will not occupy your time this evening in tracing the
origin of certain cases of cardio-vascular disease in middle and
advanced life to <em>chronic affections</em> of different kinds. Besides the
obvious effects upon the heart, blood and blood-vessels, of anæmia,
exhaustion, &amp;c., we meet with such grave lesions as fatty degeneration
from pernicious anæmia and other blood disorders; profound
circulatory derangements and occasionally valvular lesions in
Graves's disease, and others.</p>

<p>8. I now pass on to <em>complex causes</em>. In addition to the definite
and distinct influences which I have mentioned as threatening the
heart in this stage of life, there are two which are intimately
associated with other causes of cardio-vascular disease, but still
deserve to stand out independently. The first of these is emphysema,
and along with it other chronic affections of the lungs and
pleura, which strain the right ventricle; the second is chronic
Bright's disease, which similarly strains the left ventricle. I shall
have frequent occasion to return to these two morbid states in
different parts of my subject. I mention them here to give them
the position which they deserve as influences that threaten the
function and still more the structure of the heart and arteries.
They are often associated with each other, and each or both of them
with one or more of the unfavourable influences I have just
enumerated, particularly alcohol, disordered metabolism and gout.
And this brings me to the many instances in which the different
influences that threaten the circulatory organs in middle and
advanced life act together in different combinations. Alcoholism is
equally common amongst the poor, whose circulation is subjected to
mechanical stress, whilst it is impoverished by want; the well-to-do,
who lead luxurious, sedentary enervating lives; and, as I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
already observed, the keen active business or professional man who
overworks his brain on stimulants. In this country at least, gout
appears to be all-pervading, and as an unfavourable influence on
heart and vessels it often cannot be dissociated from alcohol,
sedentary habits, worry, plumbism, Bright's disease and emphysema.</p>

<p>Thus, in our study of combinations of morbific influences we come
to appreciate the evil effect of certain <em>occupations</em> upon the circulation
in middle life. The business man is exposed to the unhealthy
actions on his heart of confinement to a close office or shop, worry,
irregular hasty feeding, alcoholic indulgence in connection with his
trade or profession, and unwise attempts at violent muscular
exercise at the week-end or in the holiday season; or he may be
guilty of entire disregard of the rules of bodily and mental hygiene,
and bring on in this way premature degeneration of his cardio-vascular
system. Still more numerous are the causes at work in
the production of "soldier's heart." We have but to picture to
ourselves, if we can, the physical strain, the mental excitement, the
bodily hardships&mdash;including exposure to both extremes of temperature&mdash;and
the coarse fare which have been the lot of many
thousands of our brave troops in the Boer war, to understand how
the fighting soldier "ages" quickly, and, in particular, ages in his
heart and arteries. Add to these unfavourable influences syphilis,
alcohol and tobacco (which, unfortunately, must be added in many
instances), and the chance of escape from disease of the circulation
in the soldier is practically <em>nil</em>. But "soldier's heart" is also met
with elsewhere than in the army. The clergyman from the slums
of London or other great city, who has lived and toiled and&mdash;it may
be said truly&mdash;has fought with various success through alternate
periods of excitement and depression, and has thus suffered much
both in mind and body, comes to us with high-tension pulse, a
tortuous radial artery, a large heart and a systolic murmur over the
aorta, and complains of an attack of angina. His wife, who has
laboured in the parish for years (she is 76, and still active in her
work of charity), has also a thickened radial artery, a large heart,
and a systolic basic murmur, with no discoverable cause of these
evidences of a diseased circulation but the life that she has led
amongst the poor around her. Perhaps such cases of cardio-vascular
disease might be most correctly said to be due to the wear and tear
of life. They are met with also in the traveller or explorer, who
has spent most of his life in search of adventure; and they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
found in a man who has never left home, but whose years have been
filled with the toil and anxiety of his position as an owner of land,
or with prolonged litigation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Such are the principal natural influences which individually or
in different combinations threaten or assail the sound heart and
blood vessels after the age of 40. I have given but a broad, hasty
sketch of them entirely from my own recent observations, and I
know that I have omitted some which in your opinion might deserve
mention, but which possess no special interest in relation to this
period of life&mdash;for example, the agents of acute infections of the
endocardium, and also new growths, pregnancy and parturition.
Let me now sum up the results, and say that whatever changes the
cardio-vascular system may present in middle and advanced life,
beyond those which we have found to be natural to it at those
particular periods, are pathological&mdash;the result of physical stress,
nervous influences, extrinsic poisons, disturbances of metabolism,
syphilis, acute disease, or chronic disease; or are associated with
chronic nephritis, emphysema or different combinations of the preceding
causes, with various occupations or positions in life, or with
other influences of less importance. It is necessary, however, to
qualify this statement in two respects. In the first place, the heart
and vessels may have been so damaged already, that is, in early life,
that they fall victims to influences which, whether in kind or in
degree, would have been insufficient to produce idiopathic disease of
these organs. This brings me to the subject of old-standing
valvular disease (mostly rheumatic in origin), chronic strain, and
adherent pericardium in middle-aged and old subjects. A considerable
proportion of our cases are of this type, and they have
to be mentioned here for the sake of giving completeness to the plan
of arrangement, but they are outside the range of our immediate
subject. In the second place, hearts and arteries at 40 that appear
to the naked eye free from damage may be molecularly weak, and
unable to offer effective resistance even to influences of an every-day
character. I have now arrived at the last, and certainly one of the
most interesting, of the causes of disease of the heart and arteries
in middle and advanced life. There are some persons whose hearts
and arteries cannot carry them through the wear and tear of what
may be called ordinary life for more than 40 or 50 years. The vital
energy of the tissues of these organs is exhausted prematurely;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
they are already old at 45; degeneration of the muscle and other
cells sets in early, reminding us of the essential myopathic paralysis
of children. This type of case is described as "family heart," for
it also runs in families&mdash;three, four, five, or more members of which,
as in a number of instances that I have observed, may have all died
suddenly of cardiac disease&mdash;some of them at an early age.
Similarly, it is not by any means unusual to find quite young
subjects, say of 30, with vessels already much enlarged; and I may
add, equally young subjects with their lungs already emphysematous
although there is no history of respiratory strain, reminding
us of the very common association of emphysema with arterial
sclerosis in old age. These cases of family heart and premature
arterial sclerosis are the links that connect disease of the heart and
arteries in middle and advanced life of definitely pathological origin
with the genuinely senile changes in the tissue-elements which
render existence untenable at last, and which may be said to be
the result of the exhaustion of their nutritional activity by "the
thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LECTURE II.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President and Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;In my last lecture I presented
to you a brief account of the condition of the organs of
circulation between the ages of 40 and 75, and I then proceeded
to direct your attention to the principal influences which may
disorder and damage them during that period of life. I will now
attempt to describe the clinical characters and course of the
affections of the heart and arteries, as I have observed them, in
connection with these different influences respectively&mdash;whether
gout, mechanical stress, syphilis, or other. Thereafter, if time
permits, I may be able to examine the different symptoms and
signs individually in order to discover the value of each as a guide
in diagnosis.</p>

<p>Now, as I have already pointed out, the causes of cardio-vascular
disease in the second half of life are very often, indeed usually,
complex. It follows, therefore, that if we desire, as we do most
particularly, to discover the effects of each pathogenetic influence
as distinguished from the others, we must begin our study with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the simplest, or purest, or most definite of all, and proceed from
it towards those which are more difficult, as well as to combinations
of causes. It is easy to adopt this method in our present inquiry.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Tobacco Heart.</span></h3>

<p>We have in tobacco a single distinct influence at work; one that
is universally acknowledged to affect the heart and vessels, and the
physiological action of which is understood; one, further, that can
be removed (perhaps not without some difficulty, for I have had
a patient plead for his pipe with tears in his eyes), and certainly
that can always be resumed with remarkable readiness&mdash;in a word,
a most favourable subject of observation by experiment. It is well,
too, to begin the study of tobacco heart in young men, whose
circulation is still structurally sound, and thereafter to follow up
the subject in middle-aged and old persons. Adopting this line
of inquiry, I have found that the uncomplicated effects of tobacco
on young healthy hearts, as they present themselves clinically, are:
palpitation in every instance; a sense of irregular action,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> post-sternal
oppression and pain in half the cases; and in one out of
every eight sufferers either angina or uncomfortable sensations
in the left arm. Faintness or actual faints occurred in one-third,
and giddiness and a feeling of impending death in a smaller
proportion. Turning to the physical signs, the heart proves to
be of ordinary size in 50 per cent. of the patients; in a few it is
very slightly enlarged; the præcordial impulse is often very weak,
but occasionally increased in force and frequency, and almost as
often irregular as not; the pulse tension, with insignificant exceptions,
I have always found low. Very interesting, in the light of
what I shall tell you later on, is the fact that of 20 of these patients
complaining of the heart not one presented a cardiac murmur
beyond a weak mitral systolic bruit, varying with posture or
cubitus. This is in accordance with the teachings of pharmacology
&mdash;that tobacco acts on the terminal branches of the vagus.</p>

<p>Now we are in a position to study the tobacco heart in a man of
40; and again let us begin with a man who is sound, active, and
healthy otherwise. He complains of his heart, and recognises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
willingly (for he belongs to our own profession), in the discomfort
and anxiety from which he suffers, the penalty of having smoked for
years the strongest and blackest tobacco that he could buy. Yet
his heart is not enlarged, and the cardiac sounds might be described
as ordinary were they not peculiarly irregular, the frequency
changing every moment and a falter occurring at short intervals.
There is not a trace of murmur to be found in connection with
the valves and orifices. At ages over 40 a clinical study of the
tobacco heart is highly instructive from a practical point of view.
Whilst palpitation is still the common complaint, pain, including
angina, is put forward more prominently, and so are faintness,
actual faints, a feeling of impending death, and a sense of cardiac
irregularity, each intermission being accompanied with a sudden
stab through the præcordia. Some of you will remember Mr.
Barrie's quaint account in 'My Lady Nicotine' of what he calls
the horrors of his smoking days, when the pain at his heart made
him hold his breath&mdash;"a sting" as he describes it, and he believed
he was dying. In these subjects the heart is more frequently found
to be large and feeble; the same weak systolic murmur is occasionally
to be heard; the radial pulse is often irregular, and the vessel
wall naturally thick. This, you will notice, is a combination of
symptoms and signs sufficient to alarm the casual observer. But
when we examine it more deliberately, in the light of our study
of the tobacco heart in young subjects, on the one hand, and of
our knowledge of the normal or natural condition of the heart and
arteries at 60, on the other hand, we are able to reassure ourselves
and our patients. We are justified in concluding not only that
every cardio-vascular lesion which may be found in tobacco smokers
is not to be put to the credit of tobacco, but, <em>vice versâ</em> (and this
is of more interest to us in our present inquiry), that every
præcordial pain, angina, faintness, or irregular pulse in a man
of 60 with a full-sized heart is not to be hastily regarded as
evidences of grave disease without further inquiry as to his habits.
The cardiac enlargement and large pulse may be nothing more than
the result of a life of bodily and mental activity: the præcordial
distress may be the result only of tobacco. How very necessary
this caution is will be impressed upon your consideration by the
two following cases. The first is that of a man of 60, actively
engaged in professional pursuits, who first suffered from præcordial
pain of an alarming character four and a half years ago, and has had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
attacks since, particularly during exertion and after meals. One
day last autumn, at the end of many hours' hard work, cheered by
at least 18 cigarettes, he was rushing off to dine with a friend
when he was suddenly seized with præcordial pain which he
described as fearful, radiating down the left arm. He broke into
a cold sweat, thought that his last hour had come, and for a short
time had impairment of consciousness. Shortly after this event
he took the advice of his doctors and gave up tobacco (shall I
say for a time?), and from that day to this, now six months, he has
had no further trouble with his heart.</p>

<p>The second case is equally striking. A man of 55, of fairly
active disposition and somewhat full habit of body, was suddenly
seized with angina pectoris in October, 1899. The pain was of
a dull bursting character over the region of the heart, and it passed
into the left shoulder, down to the elbow, and settled particularly
in the wrist. At the same time there was pain in the upper
maxillary region. The heart slowed down from 75 to 50, and
the sufferer felt that he was dying. From that time anginal
attacks occurred in rapid succession, five, six, nine or even eleven
in a single day; occasionally they came on in the night. This
experience continued for nearly two months on end; indeed, it was
six months before the angina finally ceased. It was instantly
relieved with amyl nitrite; nitro-glycerin was unsuccessful. In
the course of giving advice to this patient I fortunately discovered
that he had just laid in a stock of 2,000 cigars. The line of treatment
was obvious; and the result has been, as I have said, complete
recovery.</p>

<p>I have dwelt on the subject of tobacco heart perhaps longer than
was necessary, addressing, as I am, a meeting of practitioners of
experience and not a class of clinical students. I have done so
to bring home to us an important consideration which we are
all apt to overlook in diagnosis and still more in treatment, namely,
that whether in an ordinary senile heart, or in a heart that is the
seat of chronic valvular disease, or in arterial degeneration, something
more than the pathological changes have in many instances
to be regarded&mdash;usually some entirely adventitious disturbance
which alone calls for treatment, such as indigestion, flatulence,
worry, a bronchial catarrh, or it may be free indulgence in tobacco,
tea or coffee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">The Heart in Alcoholism.</span></h3>

<p>Let us now pass on to consider, from the clinical point of view,
the effect on the organs of circulation of another morbific influence
of a definite kind, namely, alcohol, or perhaps more correctly
alcoholism, leaving on one side the questions of form and strength
of the drink taken and its purity.</p>

<p>The direct effects of alcohol on the heart and the blood-vessels
are by no means so easily determined as those of tobacco. In the
first place, they are complicated with the many indirect effects
which it produces on these organs by deranging the functions of
alimentation and assimilation, the nervous system and the kidneys,
and with the secondary effects on the vessels and heart of chronic
nephritis due to the same cause. In the second place, as we saw
in my first lecture, alcoholism is very commonly associated with
nervous strain, with gout and goutiness, with tobacco, with syphilis,
and not uncommonly with two, or more, or all of these together.
Eliminating as far as possible these sources of error by careful
selection of cases, I find that the alcoholic heart in middle and
advanced life presents clinical characters, as a whole, very different
from those of tobacco heart, which we have just studied. The
most striking and important of these are the evidences of actual
pathological change in the size of the heart and the condition of the
myocardium. We found no evidence that tobacco causes serious
cardiac enlargement, and neither may alcohol in quite young
subjects, who present mainly excited action both in force and in
frequency. But of 28 cases of alcoholic heart which I examined
clinically in connection with the present inquiry in older subjects,
only two hearts were of ordinary size (and as a matter of fact both
of these patients were under 40 years of age). This result is in
accord with my pathological observations. For instance, I have
carefully followed the condition of the heart in an intemperate
man of 43, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post mortem</i> found the heart to weigh 17 ounces, to
be universally dilated in all its chambers, and to present enlargement
of the mitral opening without valvular lesion, corresponding
with a weak apex systolic murmur heard during life. These results
are also in accord with those in Dr. Maguire's cases of acute
dilatation of the heart from alcoholism, which he recorded as long
ago as 1888<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> (when, I may add, doubts were expressed of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
correctness of his conclusions by several of our best authorities
on cardiac disease), and one of which occurred in a man of 23.
Dr. Mott has found fatty degeneration of the myocardium in
patients dying suddenly during alcoholism.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> With hardly an
exception the præcordial impulse is weak&mdash;indeed, it is often
imperceptible; the sounds are small and feeble, and may be almost
inaudible; in 20 per cent. of my cases a weak apex systolic
murmur could be heard, varying with posture and from day to day,
significant, no doubt, of leakage through a dilated mitral opening.
The alcoholic heart is irregular and accelerated in about half the
cases. The pulse tension is usually low; in one-third of the
instances the radial artery was sclerosed; in one-fifth of them
there was slight albuminuria; the legs may be œdematous. The
complaints which the patient makes to us are commonly of
palpitation of the heart, faintness or actual faints, and præcordial
pain; but it is very interesting to observe that angina pectoris
is rare in the alcoholic as compared with the tobacco heart, in the
ratio of 4 to 15 per cent. With these cardiac symptoms proper
there are usually associated the sweats, coldness of the extremities,
and depression, sinking or lowness characteristic of alcoholism.
But it is unnecessary for me to fill in this outline sketch of the
condition of the victim of either acute, or sub-acute, or chronic
alcoholism. I would rather mention one form of acute alcoholic
failure of the heart of which I have recently seen a case, but which
appears to be rare. A middle-aged woman, at the end of each
of her repeated bouts of active alcoholism, has violent sickness;
prostration passes into collapse, and for 24 hours or more she lies
flat on her back, with all the phenomena of what may be called
acute air-hunger. She breathes loudly and deeply, at the rate of
36 per minute, with groaning expiration. The expression is alarmed,
despairing and imploring; the nose is pinched; the surface is
livid and cold; the breath is cold; the pulse is practically imperceptible
at the wrist; and yet the præcordial impulse is both strong
and extensive, and the rate of the heart greatly accelerated. The
condition is at once one of collapse and urgent dyspnœa, quite as in
one form of so-called diabetic coma; and it is further remarkable
in that it may pass off suddenly after having lasted, as I have said,
for many hours. It is difficult to resist the conclusion that in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
a condition as this some product of alcohol, present in the blood, is
the cause of the remarkable phenomena.</p>

<p>The course of alcoholic heart in older subjects usually becomes
affected by the appearance of cirrhosis of the liver, Bright's disease,
neuritis, and possibly dementia. The method of termination is
very various, including ordinary cardiac failure with dropsy; and
sudden death occasionally occurs. Still, recovery is far from being
impossible, even after dropsy has made its appearance, for the size
of the heart may decline under strict abstinence from alcohol, and
the œdema disappear. This is a matter of great practical interest,
inasmuch as we know that, whilst the effect of alcohol on the heart
and circulation is for a time functional only, it presently becomes
truly nutritional, as in the cases I have just narrated. The
myocardium is not always beyond repair, although it and the fine
myelinated fibres of the vagus undergo fatty degeneration according
to Dr. Mott,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> just as there are changes in the pyramidal cells and
fibres of the cerebral cortex in the alcoholic; and the feebleness
and irregularity of the heart are analogues of the depression and
confusion of the brain.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Gout.</span></h3>

<p>Of the many instances of disorder and disease of the heart and
arteries that I have met with in gouty subjects at or over 40 years
of age, I have made a careful study of 29 taken from my private
case-books. Twelve of these (10 M. + 2 F.) had suffered from
ordinary articular gout, the other 17 (6 M. + 11 F.) had irregular
gout, as defined in my first lecture. The average age was 62. In
no instance was there albuminuria. The physical condition of the
heart and arteries and the patient's complaints were remarkably
alike in the two groups. In 23 of the 29 the heart proved to be
enlarged, either on one or both sides. In less than half the number
the cardiac action was feeble; in a small number the impulse was
entirely imperceptible; the heart- and pulse- rate was ordinary; the
rhythm was but seldom irregular. It is a very remarkable fact
that in no fewer than 12 out of the 29 cases of gouty heart a
systolic murmur was to be heard over the aortic area, the manubrium
and the right carotid, significant of disease either of the aortic arch
or of the aortic valves&mdash;in every instance independently of rheumatism
or other obvious cause than gout. This result is an interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
confirmation of the pathological observations of Dr. Norman Moore
and Sir Dyce Duckworth given by the latter,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and of the statement
of Murchison<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> of his experience "that atheroma of the arteries at
an unusually early period of life, and diseases of the aortic valves
which are not congenital, and are independent of injury or rheumatism,
are met with far oftener in persons who are the subjects of
the lithic acid dyscrasia, or who have had gout, than in those who
have had no such tendencies." In seven (25 per cent.) of my cases
a more or less developed systolic murmur was found in the mitral
area, significant either of valvular atheroma and sclerosis or of leakage
from ventricular dilatation. Very curiously I have never met
with aortic incompetence of gouty origin. When no murmur exists
the cardiac sounds are commonly somewhat feeble, and the second
sound may be of ringing quality&mdash;this more commonly in goutiness
than in developed gout. In agreement with this connection, the
radial pulse is more often tense in the subjects of irregular than
of regular gout<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>; altogether, high tension is found in more than
one-half of the cases. The great majority presented distinct
thickening of the arterial walls. As I suggested in our study of
the etiology, these pathological changes appear to be the result
of malnutrition of structures (the myocardium, valves and arteries)
worked at high pressure; and in addition to the local disturbance
of metabolism in the cardiac and arterial walls, which are fed
with gouty blood, there is the damaging effect on them of similar
disease of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vasa vasorum</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vasa cordis</i> or coronaries.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Besides
a distressing feeling of irregularity, fluttering or intermittency, and
dyspnœa on exertion, men who are the subjects of gouty heart
complain most frequently of præcordial pain; women more often
of palpitation and faintness or actual faints. In quite one-fourth of
all cases of gouty heart the pain is anginal, and such angina may be
of the most pronounced type. A friend of my own, aged 60, began
to suffer from gouty angina (diagnosed to be such by his family
physician 40 years ago) at the age of 20. Almost every year,
somewhat more frequently for the last 12 years of his life, he was
liable to be seized with intense pain in the left side of the chest,
which rapidly extended to the neck and down the left arm, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
tingling in the hand; a sense of great constriction in the chest;
faintness, and difficulty of breathing. He had immediately to rest,
whereupon the distress subsided; but it did not perfectly disappear
for hours. On different occasions also, in connection with these
anginal seizures, I have known him have free hæmoptysis, complete
unconsciousness, vomiting, and sudden violent evacuation of the
bowels. He also suffered from articular gout, and from irregular
gout in almost every possible form.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Obesity and Glycosuria.</span></h3>

<p>Closely related to goutiness is a clinical type of disturbed metabolism,
mainly characterised by corpulence, a bulky, flabby build,
and glycosuria. Of this type, represented by 12 cases in my series,
nine had glycosuria and two albuminuria; eight were men; the
average age was 58. Only one had suffered from true articular
gout. Here, again, the interesting observation was made that no
less than three-fourths of the number had a systolic aortic murmur,
none of them a regurgitant aortic murmur, and nearly one-half
of them an ill-developed mitral systolic murmur. Thus there
appears to be more liability to atheroma in the gross corpulent
diabetic even than in the gouty man. In all the cases the heart
appeared to be enlarged, but accurate physical examination is
difficult or impossible in many of these subjects. The impulse was
more often feeble than in the gouty; the cardiac sounds were
equally weak, and the second aortic sound was occasionally accentuated.
The pulse corresponded with the gouty pulse in thickness
and tension, but it was more often found irregular and hurried. As
for the complaints of corpulent and diabetic patients, they prove to
be very similar to those of gouty individuals in respect of pain, but
neither palpitation, faintness nor irregularity was so often mentioned.</p>

<p>It must not be understood from what I have just said in my
account of these cases that all disturbances of the heart in gouty
subjects progress to valvular or vascular degeneration, with associated
cardiac enlargement and degeneration. The friend whose case I
have just described at some length had led an active life, as I
said, for 40 years; and, as I hope to show in my next lecture,
the condition is amenable to treatment if this is based on a correct
appreciation of the cause that is at work. But it is equally true
that if correct advice be not given, or if it be given but be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
neglected, as happens so frequently, the endocardium and the aorta
and other arteries steadily degenerate, chronic interstitial nephritis
makes its appearance, and the patient dies either slowly from
cardiac failure or suddenly from cerebral hæmorrhage.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Cardiac Strain.</span></h3>

<p>I will now proceed to consider the clinical characters of a class of
cases in which you, Sir, are particularly interested&mdash;strain of the
heart in middle and advanced life. To make this part of my
subject more plain, I will discuss in the first place acute strain
of the heart as it occurs after the fortieth year; afterwards I will
consider the condition of the heart and arteries at this age in
persons who have strained them in youth or early manhood.</p>

<p>A man of 65, who came to me complaining of his heart, gave the
following account of the commencement of his trouble:&mdash;Four years
previously, on making a very hard stroke at golf (the ball was
bunkered), he was suddenly seized with a sensation of something
having happened in his heart. He played up to the next hole, but
now felt the chest oppressed; he sat down and got relief. This
experience was repeated, and he gave up the round. Walking
home two miles, he had to sit down occasionally with the same
feeling. Ever since that occurrence exertion had produced the
same effect. I found the ordinary physical signs of enlargement
of both sides of the heart; a scarcely perceptible impulse; the
cardiac sounds extremely feeble, the second being of a finely ringing
quality; the pulse tense, quiet and regular, but the radial artery
by no means sclerosed. The patient's principal complaints were of
irregular action of the heart, which troubled him on lying down
or when he was dyspeptic; and, as I have said, of post-sternal
oppression on exertion. This man had neither albuminuria nor
emphysema, but he had frequently suffered from ordinary articular
gout. Belonging to this type of cardiac strain I have notes in all
of 11 cases, which I will briefly summarise. Eight were men, three
women; and their average age was 56. In all but one of them the
heart was large, with feeble præcordial impulse; the sounds were
small and feeble; the aortic diastolic sound was often ringing; in
but one case was there a murmur&mdash;aortic systolic; with few exceptions
the rhythm and the rate of the heart were ordinary. In half
the cases the radial artery was sclerosed; in the majority the tension<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
was not increased. Persons who strain their heart after middle life
chiefly complain of præcordial oppression, dyspnœa on exertion,
a sense of palpitation and irregular action of the heart, and pain,
which may amount to angina; and they may tell us that distress
and disability in these different forms have troubled them for years.
You will have observed that the man whose case I have read in
particular was the subject of gout; and this brings me to the
interesting fact that of these 11 individuals seven were gouty. We
have already seen how greatly reduced is the resistance of the
cardio-vascular system in gouty subjects; and we are prepared for
the readiness with which their heart may be strained by exertion&mdash;a
matter of obvious importance prophylactically. In other cases
not included in this group the strain took the form of valvular
injury, or it affected hearts already the seats of old-standing valvular
lesions of rheumatic origin; but the present is not the occasion to
discuss these. Nor need I add that a not infrequent result of acute
strain of the aged heart, whether its valves have been already
damaged or its myocardium badly nourished, is sudden death.
Now, I can understand that some of my audience might object
to the application of the term "strain" to the effect of exertion in
gouty and senile hearts, just as Professor Clifford Allbutt, who is
universally recognised as the earliest and highest authority on this
subject, suggests that the clinical expression "strain of the heart"
relates only to comparatively young subjects free or nearly free
from degeneration.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> It might be contended with great reason
that exertion in these subjects is not a cause of strain or dilatation
of the heart, but simply a test, as it were, or the proof, of cardiac
debility and disability. But when we come to consider cardiac
strain a little more closely, it may be just as easily maintained that
every dilated heart, every dilated cardiac chamber, every dilated
blood-vessel has been strained. Whether, on the one hand, valvular
disease, Bright's disease or emphysema, or, on the other hand,
myocardial degeneration, has disturbed that cardinal condition of
a normal circulation that the driving power must always exceed
the resistance ahead, over-distension and dilatation of the cavities,
with excessive stretching of their walls, constitute or consist in
mechanical strain. However, laying aside theoretical discussions of
this character, the great practical fact remains, that when the aged
and ill-nourished heart is over-distended from sudden and severe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
exertion, neither the elastic nor the muscular tissues of its walls
can bear the strain; it becomes dilated; for the future it acts at
a mechanical disadvantage; and as often as this may occur it suffers
still more in its efficiency. On the other hand, it is really in confirmation
of this consideration, though apparently in opposition to
it, that the heart may diminish somewhat in size, and præcordial
distress disappear, under strict treatment continued for a sufficient
length of time.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Strain Before Forty.</span></h3>

<p>A more interesting group of cases than those which I have just
discussed is composed of persons who have strained their hearts in
youth or early manhood, have never been quite well since, and in
middle or advanced life are at last driven to us for help. Cases of
this character would furnish excellent material from which we might
attempt to judge of the after-effects of excess or abuse of muscular
exercise in the young. This is a tempting subject of discussion, but
one far too long and much too important to be taken up casually at
this time. Therefore, I will content myself with submitting to you
as plainly as I can certain facts bearing on it that have come before
me in my present inquiry, along with a few simple observations of a
practical bearing. First, then, let me read to you the history of
what I should call a typical case of the kind. A man of 69 complains
that as often as he walks any distance or climbs a stair he is
arrested by a distressing sense of having a bar across the lower end
of the sternum, breathlessness, irregular palpitation of the heart,
and a very little choking in the throat; the discomfort has lately
deserved the name of pain. His heart is very large, the area of
præcordial dulness being increased in all directions and measuring
transversely 7 inches. The impulse is weak over the left ventricle,
but definite in the epigastrium; the sounds come in couples&mdash;moderately
good and very weak respectively, without murmur; and
the radial artery is large and thick, with rather low pressure and
irregular rhythm. It turns out that for the last 40 years these
uncomfortable feelings have troubled the man more or less, and that
at three different periods of his life&mdash;at 31, at 42 and at 67&mdash;they
increased so much as to incapacitate him for many months, the first
time with a sudden sense of something snapping in the heart, the
second time with a faint, and always, as he believes, consequent on
overwork. Now this man never had rheumatism, nor gout, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
syphilis, and was always a temperate, careful liver; and he volunteers
the statement that he first felt his heart at Cambridge, where
he was captain of his College boat, and was tried for the University
boat but felt that he was not fit for it. Belonging to this type of
cardiac strain I have selected 11 cases. The heart is always found
to be enlarged, and in about one-half of the cases it is irregular. It
may be weak and beating at the ordinary rate, but in other
instances it is increased both in force and frequency. Only in quite
exceptional cases did I meet with endocardial murmurs in this group
of old strained hearts; as a rule the sounds were ordinary, with a
disposition to accentuation of the aortic second sound. High tension
and sclerosis of the radial artery were respectively found in about
one-half of the cases. The patients complain most commonly of a
distressing sense of irregular palpitation of the heart, and very
commonly of præcordial pain, but rarely of angina. Faintness also
is sometimes mentioned. Let me hasten to add, with respect to
these cases, that they do not include any instances of direct injury
of the valves mechanically. Rupture or stretching of the aortic
and mitral valves during exertion furnishes us with some very
remarkable clinical cases; but it is with parietal strain that we are
concerned now&mdash;mechanical over-stretching of the cardiac walls,
which are thereafter left with but a narrow margin of the elastic
and muscular reserve required by them to meet trying circumstances
of any kind, particularly exertion. The subjects of dilatation of
the heart from mechanical stress suffer by no means from what is
commonly called "heart disease," excepting in the worst cases, but
yet they feel their hearts comparatively, and it may be seriously,
disabled. Naturally they associate these feelings of disability with
fresh attempts at exercise or exertion, as in the case which I have
just read. I pointed out in my first lecture that such exertion is
not by any means connected with the patient's occupation or daily
duties, but quite often occurs during unwise attempts on his part to
resume at 50 the athletic exercises of his youth in order to reduce
his weight, relieve his liver, or dispel gout. It is not wonderful that
under such circumstances a permanently enlarged and badly-nourished
heart should become embarrassed, or even seriously
deranged or still further strained. I have known a man of 43,
going straight from London to the Alps, have not only præcordial
distress but dropsy of his legs after his first ascent in his regular
holiday. Indeed, the man who has reached later middle-life with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
his heart enlarged by years of great bodily activity in youth, and
settles down quietly on retirement, let us say from the navy, sometimes
finds that ordinary exercise is sufficient to produce alarming
cardiac distress and curious loss of courage, obviously due to the
muscular tissue of the thickened cardiac walls having fallen quite
out of condition. How instructive, for instance, is the following
case:&mdash;A gentleman of 60, who has led from his boyhood upwards
a life of physical activity and at the same time of temperance, and
has suffered from neither syphilis nor rheumatism, but possibly from
a very mild attack of gout, settles in a relaxing provincial town,
continues to eat heartily, and considers that a little work in the
garden is sufficient exercise for him. He increases in weight, his
breath gets short, his heart flutters, and now he begins to get
anxious about his health, fancying, as he says, that he has all sorts
of diseases&mdash;a disposition to worry about himself which is entirely
new and provoking to him. I find his heart very large and feeble,
the cardiac sounds scarcely audible, and in the mitral area a well-developed
systolic murmur. The patient is ordered to reduce his
diet as a whole and in respect of carbo-hydrates, to return carefully
to walking exercise on the level, and to take a calomel purge
followed by a saline twice a week, and a mild strychnine mixture.
He improves, and continues to do so; is able to walk miles without
discomfort; and in the course of two months not only do I find his
heart reduced in size on physical examination, but I fail to hear the
apical murmur, which must have been produced by dilatation of the
left ventricle. The bearing of such a case as this on the pathology,
prevention and treatment of certain cases of heart disease in old
subjects will be obvious to all.</p>

<p>We must be careful, however, to observe that neither unwise
abandonment of wholesome exercise, nor ill-advised return to
physical exertion, separately or in succession, can be regarded as the
only cause of the recrudescence of cardiac distress after 40 in those
who have strained their circulation in youth. Any one of the many
circumstances that produce cardiac failure and dropsy in chronic
valvular disease may lead to embarrassment and fresh dilatation of
the simply enlarged heart: anæmia and chronic disease, the acute
specific fevers including pneumonia, emphysema, granular kidney,
gout, syphilis, tobacco and alcohol poisoning, as well as anxiety and
worry, and in women the advent of the menopause; and I may say
here parenthetically that pains at the heart in athletic youths are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
sometimes due to the tobacco smoking in which they often indulge
socially when the exercise is finished&mdash;not to strain at all. In these
cases of old cardiac strain, as in every form of chronic valvular
disease and of chronic heart disease of all kinds, not only the original
and permanent lesion, but the recent and probably temporary
circumstance that caused the failure has to be ascertained and fully
respected in connection with prognosis and treatment.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Syphilis.</span></h3>

<p>Syphilis appears to account for a very considerable proportion
of the more serious cases of heart disease which we meet with
in older subjects&mdash;excluding of course chronic valvular disease
originating remotely in endocarditis. But I ought to repeat here
what I have already mentioned, that syphilis as a cause of cardio-vascular
lesions is very often associated with other morbific influences,
particularly strain and alcohol. Of its position as the principal
cause of grave disease of the valves as distinguished from the walls
of the heart, originating in middle life, there can be no question.
No fewer than nine out of 28 cases, of which I have private notes,
were the subjects of double aortic disease; practically all the others
had a loud ringing second sound over the aorta, significant of
degeneration; pain of anginal type in half the cases was the
prominent complaint; and two-thirds of the subjects had sclerosis
of the radial artery. When we consider that syphilis does also
affect the myocardium primarily; that fibroid disease, chronic
aneurysm and fatty degeneration of the heart are all traceable
to specific disease of the coronaries in many instances; and, finally,
that many of the subjects of syphilitic cardio-vascular disease have
perished before 40, the magnitude of this cause can be fully realised.
I believe that the profession in general have not yet woke up, if
I may say so, to the gravity of this subject. How seldom we
inquire for a history of specific disease in patients coming to us with
cardiac disease in middle life! To no one, as far as my reading
goes, are we so much indebted for the truth on this subject as to
my friend and colleague Dr. Mott. Thirteen years ago he published
a paper on 21 cases of sudden death from cardio-vascular disease,
and in nine of these there was a history of either actual or probable
syphilis. What was of greater interest, however, at that early date,
he drew attention to the association of syphilitic cardio-vascular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
lesions with Bright's disease in the broad acceptation of the term.
Dr. Mott's work in the interval on syphilitic lesions of the arterial
system of the brain has been so brilliant, and is so generally known,
that it requires nothing more than this appreciative mention by me,
and it saves me the trouble of an excursion into the subjects of
cerebral hæmorrhage and thrombosis in connection with these lectures.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Nervous Strain.</span></h3>

<p>I confess that it is difficult to say much that is of real diagnostic
value on the clinical aspect of cardio-vascular disorders and disease
from nervous strain. As I remarked in discussing this subject from
the etiological point of view, several factors come into play besides
nervous excitement followed by exhaustion and their effects on the
heart, great vessels and cerebral arteries; and the cases, therefore,
are found to present a puzzling variety of features. Certain clinical
characters are, however, common to the majority. Arterial tension
is high; the radial artery is thick, sometimes markedly so; the
heart enlarges; and in about one-half of the cases a systolic murmur
is to be heard either in the aortic or in the mitral area, significant
of chronic endocardial lesions&mdash;all readily intelligible results of
cerebral strain in the light of our knowledge of the innervation
of the cardio-vascular system. I have already pointed out that in
some of these patients polyuria and temporary albuminuria occur
along with the high tension and the increased action of the heart;
but the heart may fail later on. The direct cardiac symptoms of
which they complain are of the ordinary character, palpitation with
accelerated cardiac frequency and pain (not angina) being the most
common at first, feelings of indescribable discomfort and suffocation
in the more advanced stage. A great deal that I might have had
to say on the very interesting subjects of pseudo-angina, and the
climacteric and pre-climacteric disturbances of the circulation in
women, I am reluctantly compelled to omit from want of time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After having reviewed, as I have attempted to do, the principal
clinical characters of the disorders and diseases of middle and
advanced life under their several causes, it may appear for a
moment strange that the most important of all the clinical types
of cardio-vascular degeneration has been mentioned only incidentally.
This is chronic Bright's disease, which, from its complex
pathological relations, its widespread effects on the heart and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
circulation and the organs that they supply, and the far greater
gravity of these than those of any of the other causes which we have
studied (unless it be syphilis), is a subject of endless interest to
us all. Fortunately for me my immediate predecessor in this
chair on the medical side, our distinguished Fellow, Dr. Samuel
West, took for his subject the "Clinical Aspects of Granular
Kidney," and thus relieved me of a task which he was so much
better able to discharge than I. Emphysema must also be passed
over with the single remark that it is a very common accompaniment
both of vascular and cardiac degenerations.</p>

<p>I trust you do not conclude that the description which I have
just given you of the clinical characters of these various disorders
and diseases of the heart is in any sense complete. It only relates
to the most prominent symptoms and signs as they present themselves
to us in what might be called the every-day life of the
patient, at a period in the history of his case precedent to failure.
In all of them there may occur occasional attacks of acute
embarrassment of the heart and lungs from one or more of a
variety of causes, such as indigestion, excitement or over-exertion.
Sooner or later, also, there occurs either cardiac dropsy&mdash;insidiously
developed after increasing local distress, growing dyspnœa and
"bad nights"; or Bright's disease; or cerebral thrombosis or
hæmorrhage, or acute myocardial failure with angina: or the
patient dies from failure of the heart in the course of some
acute disease such as bronchitis or pneumonia. Neither have
I considered it necessary in this lecture to dwell on some of the
rarer phenomena occasionally met with, such as tachycardia and
bradycardia. I may have occasion to refer to them next time
in connection with prognosis.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>LECTURE III.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Vice-president and Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;In this, the concluding
lecture of the series, I will attempt to deal with the applications of
the facts and considerations which I submitted to you on the two
previous occasions when I had the honour to address you. I trust
that what I then laid before you proved to be of some interest.
Let us see now whether it is practically useful. However much the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
etiology and pathology of the diseases and disorders of the heart
and arteries in middle and advanced life may deserve study as
matters of natural history, we should be disappointed if they could
not be turned to account in prognosis and treatment. These are the
subjects I propose to discuss this evening.</p>

<p>Now, prognosis and treatment, to be rational and useful, have to
be based on as full and as correct a diagnosis as knowledge permits.
The present disposition is to fall short of this; to rest content with
an incomplete diagnosis. We say that the patient's "heart is
dilated," that he has "arterial degeneration," that there is "fatty
degeneration." But you will remember that we have found that
cardiac dilatation may be present in every kind of cardio-vascular
degeneration; that the arteries are naturally enlarged and thickened
after middle life, and that we refused to call these changes morbid.
Clearly, therefore, a purely anatomical diagnosis of this sort is
insufficient. If you are asked what the prognosis is of fatty
degeneration of the heart, you answer that you must first be told
whether syphilitic or gouty disease of the coronary arteries, or
strain, or alcoholism, or phosphorus-poisoning or anæmia is the
cause of it. When you are planning the treatment of dilatation
of the heart you first determine whether the dilatation is a result
of the stretching of a sound heart by overfilling during muscular
effort, or of the insufficient emptying of failing chambers with
degenerated and feeble walls. Obviously what we ought to determine
in these instances and in every instance is the origin of the
disease. The ultimate diagnosis to be reached for practical purposes
is the etiological diagnosis.</p>

<p>Is this possible? Does our knowledge of the nature, characters
and course of these cardio-vascular affections enable us to say, after
investigating a case, what the kind of the pathological change is
that constitutes the disease, or in what respect the physiological
mechanisms are disordered? Can the cause of these degenerations
of the heart and arteries be determined in each instance? How is
the practitioner to proceed to do so? What method might be
followed with advantage in making a complete diagnosis of heart
disease in older subjects?</p>

<p>A man of 60 consults us about his heart. He says that it has
caused him a good deal of concern lately. More specifically he
describes a sense of oppression behind the sternum as often as he
exerts himself, and palpitation with consciousness of irregular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
cardiac action when he goes to bed. We inquire for other familiar
cardiac symptoms, such as pain, angina, fluttering, faintness, giddiness,
and a sense of impending death. We find that one or more
are present occasionally, and that they have increased in number
and degree during the last few months or years. Perhaps cough,
nocturnal orthopnœa and dropsy may be beginning to give trouble.
The next part of the inquiry relates to the patient's previous history
from childhood upwards. Which of the acute diseases has he had?
Acute rheumatism, chorea, scarlet fever, typhoid, diphtheria and
influenza must be mentioned individually, and in women the nature
of any puerperal disease from which they may have suffered. Gout,
irregular gout, gravel, eczema, sick headache, asthma must be
inquired after with the same minuteness, and so must syphilis. We
next hear an account of any accident which the patient may have
met with, such as a blow, or a fall from a horse or a carriage. This
brings us naturally to question him about his occupation and modes
of relaxation and amusements&mdash;whether active or sedentary, regular
or irregular, their characters otherwise, and their direct effects,
including strain. More difficult to elicit is a correct account of the
patient's habits&mdash;in respect of food, stimulants and tobacco, and his
manner of life generally. As I said in my first lecture, this is an
inquiry which the family practitioner has an opportunity to carry
out much more successfully than the hospital physician or consultant.
The family practitioner has known for years of his cardiac patient's
work and worries; it may be of his large eating, of his secret
drinking, of the history of syphilis in earlier years. It is always
well also to inquire after a family history of gout, rheumatism and
heart disease. A list of questions like this sounds far more formidable
than it is in reality. A few minutes suffice to arrive at
the truth. We already have a pretty fair notion what we have to
deal with, whether strain, gout, syphilis, tobacco, an old rheumatic
lesion, or a combination of two or more of these.</p>

<p>We next proceed to physical examination, beginning with the
pulse and arteries, and passing on to the heart and associated
structures. The characters of the præcordial impulse&mdash;particularly
the seat of the apex-beat and the strength of the impulse&mdash;are
closely (I might almost say laboriously) investigated. We must
never yield to the temptation to disregard weakness or absence of
the impulse. Like many other negative signs it is apt to be overlooked.
Then the præcordial dulness is mapped out by means of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
light percussion. Finally, auscultation reveals to us the presence or
absence of murmurs and the characters of the sounds&mdash;in the
standing and recumbent postures, and, if necessary, after a little
exertion. The relative loudness of the first and second sounds
over the different parts of the præcordia is particularly worthy
of note.</p>

<p>Now let us suppose that we have found a mitral systolic murmur.
We ask ourselves whether it is structural or whether it is functional,
that is, due to relaxation and dilatation of the ventricular walls. If
structural, with which (if any) of the diseases elicited in the man's
previous history would it correspond? Most probably with gout or
glycosuria. Thus we attempt to connect the lesion with its cause,
and the cause with its effects, and have reached the ultimate
diagnosis. So with other valvular murmurs: for example, an aortic
diastolic murmur proves to be related to syphilis. If there be no
murmur audible, we naturally think of dilatation with failure, or
of enlargement from strain, from Bright's disease, from arterial
sclerosis, from emphysema, from an insufficient or impure blood-supply
in the coronary arteries, from disordered innervation, or from
some rarer cause, such as adherent pericardium; and then, with
these associations in our minds, we review once more the patient's
history, and generally succeed in our diagnosis.</p>

<p>Here let me recount the significance of the principal signs and
symptoms which I detailed to you in my last lecture, considered in
the reverse order on this occasion, some of which are of real value
in differentiating the causes of cardio-vascular degeneration. To
begin with negative facts: a mitral pre-systolic murmur is never
significant of a degenerative lesion. Secondly, when we meet with
an aortic diastolic murmur, whether alone or along with an aortic
systolic murmur, we may safely conclude that we have to deal with
something more than atheroma produced by regular or irregular
gout and associated metabolic disturbance, cardio-vascular disease
of nervous origin and alcoholic or tobacco heart, even if there be
evidence of the presence of one or more of these in the case. Aortic
incompetence developed in later life is the result of syphilis, or of
acute or chronic valvular strain; but, of course, many instances of
this lesion met with after the age of 40 can be traced to juvenile
endocarditis of rheumatic or other origin. Always a serious lesion,
aortic incompetence due to syphilis, or to syphilis and strain, is
particularly grave, as being so frequently associated with coronary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
disease and consequent myocardial degeneration&mdash;fatty or fibroid,
acute softening, and sudden fatal failure. A fully-developed basic
systolic murmur, audible over the aortic area and manubrium and
along the course of the carotid, is a very common sign of atheroma
of the aortic arch and valves and great vessels in association with
regular or irregular gout, diabetes, corpulence and allied disorders
of nutrition. It is also one of the physical signs of syphilitic and
traumatic affections of the aorta and aortic valves and of remote
endocarditis. Further, these lesions are so often accompanied by
similar degenerations in the coronary arteries and consequent
myocardial degeneration, that the basic systolic murmur ought at
least to raise the suspicion of this in the observer's mind. An
ill-developed basic systolic murmur is not uncommon in alcoholism,
chronic Bright's disease and nervous strain, but it is difficult to
dissociate from anæmia. A fully-developed systolic murmur audible
in the mitral area, I mean independently of ventriculo-auricular
leakage in cardiac failure, is usually traceable to early endocarditis
of rheumatic or other origin, rarely to injury, including ordinary
juvenile strain of the valves or walls, or to Graves's disease. But
in some instances it is unquestionably due to valvular atheroma and
attendant sclerosis, caused by gout or other disturbances of metabolism,
including the effects of free living; and in these instances
the observer must not overlook the possible association of coronary
disease and fatty degeneration. If a systolic mitral murmur prove
to be somewhat indefinite and affected by posture, cubitus and
effort, to vary under observation from day to day, and to disappear
under treatment, it is of no more value to us in differential diagnosis
than that it signifies relaxation and weakness, or disorderly
action, of the left ventricle, consequent on any one of the recognised
causes of failure or disturbance of the heart, including the different
cardiac poisons, overwork, anæmia, acute disease, poverty and the
like, and this whether in a heart previously sound or previously
enlarged or previously the seat of valvular disease. An accentuated
ringing second sound in the aortic area, or more extensively, is of
great value in the diagnosis of arterial tension and of aortic atheroma
or of both, but it is associated with far too many different causes
to be of much use in differential diagnosis. It should suggest a
most careful search for Bright's disease. Slight reduplication of
the first sound is common over the heart strained in youth and
the heart degenerated by alcoholism and metabolic disorders, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
everyone knows that it is not unusual in a variety of other conditions,
healthy and morbid. On the other hand, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bruit de galop</i>,
or cantering rhythm of cardiac sounds&mdash;definite doubling of the
first sound followed by loud, accentuated, ringing second sound&mdash;is
practically pathognomonic of Bright's disease, and is one of the
most valuable, because one of the most ominous, of physical signs
in connection with the cardio-vascular system. A normally-sized
heart with irregularity, increased frequency, and a variable systolic
murmur in the mitral area, is characteristic of tobacco poisoning.
A heart enlarged on both sides, and acting irregularly without
murmur, is (apart from cardiac failure) suggestive of strain in
early life.</p>

<p>Cardiac symptoms taken individually are of less diagnostic value
than signs. No symptom is pathognomonic. Palpitation is a
nearly universal phenomenon of cardiac disease and disorder.
Faintness and actual faints are not uncommon in cases of early
cardiac strain, gouty heart, and nervous disturbances. Angina
we meet with, you will remember, in regular and irregular gout,
tobacco heart, strain (especially strain after 40), and in syphilis
and alcoholism, whilst pseudo-angina is extremely common in
nervous women: thus angina is of less diagnostic value than might
have been expected. A high-tension pulse I have found most often
in Bright's disease, in juvenile strain, and in cardio-vascular affections
of nervous origin; a low tension pulse in connection with
alcoholic and tobacco poisoning, and with senile strain.</p>

<p>When we review these facts, I think we are entitled to conclude
that the physical signs and symptoms carefully determined by
clinical investigation may be confidently employed, along with the
patient's previous personal history, and the history of his present
illness, to differentiate from each other the causes of cardio-vascular
degeneration in individual cases. And, further, that they
inform us of the seat of at least some of the lesions, valvular,
parietal and vascular. A little trouble, patience and attentive
observation are all that are required to reach a complete or working
diagnosis. Now we may approach the great practical subjects of
prognosis and treatment with some confidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Prognosis.</span></h3>

<p>Beginning with the simplest kind of cardio-vascular disorder, let
us see what the prognosis is in tobacco heart. You will have
gathered from what I had to say on this subject in my last lecture,
and indeed you know as men of observation and experience, that
it is comparatively favourable. All the cases I have had an
opportunity to watch did well, provided the cause of their distress
was avoided and the heart and vessels were otherwise healthy.
Further, improvement begins early, and it may be rapid and
recovery complete; but you will remember that one patient, whose
case I detailed to you, continued to have alarming angina for six
months after giving up tobacco. Recurrence attends resumption of
the habit, but some of its votaries contrive to continue to smoke
just short of inducing serious discomfort. Unless a successful
effort at reform be made, cardiac trouble may continue indefinitely.
But even then I cannot say that I have seen serious damage done
by tobacco alone in sound hearts, nor arterial sclerosis, as has been
stated by some authorities.</p>

<p>An entirely different and most unfavourable estimate is to be
formed of the prospect of life in the alcoholic heart. Naturally,
a certain proportion of cases recover if the disease be of recent
development, the condition uncomplicated, and treatment faithfully
carried out. Unfortunately, as a rule, we have to deal with
alcoholism in which all these conditions of success are wanting.
The habit is established, other organs besides the heart are involved,
other diseases than alcoholism are present, and the patient has
neither the inclination nor the power to follow our advice.
Cirrhosis, neuritis, dementia complicate the cardiac degeneration,
or, more correctly, it complicates one or all of these. Chronic
Bright's disease is made to account for a number of deaths in the
mortality returns that strictly belong to alcoholism. Occasionally
the end comes suddenly from fatty degeneration, or in the course
of some acute disease; otherwise, as we have seen, by slow cardiac
failure and dropsy.</p>

<p>Prognosis in gouty heart, including the heart of the man with
goutiness, glycosuria and other irregular forms of the disease,
is a subject of considerable practical difficulty. In my last lecture
I read to you a short account of the case of a friend of my own
who had had occasional attacks of gouty angina for 40 years.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
And certainly a large proportion of the old ladies of 60 or 70,
whom you all have had as patients for years on end with weak
heart and systolic murmur in the aortic area, owe their disablement
to gout, if my observations are correct. The lesion proper of the
aorta and aortic valves in these cases is atheroma, but the damage
is accompanied with repair in the form of sclerosis, which, by
increasing the loudness of the bruit, adds unreasonably to our
anxiety about the case. Equally certain it is that patients
belonging to this class improve under treatment. Still, the condition
of arrest cannot go on indefinitely. In addition to extrinsic
dangers, particularly those of Bright's disease, cerebral thrombosis
and hæmorrhage, and bronchitis, failure of the heart is liable to
supervene and prove fatal from the gravest of all intrinsic causes,
namely, coronary degeneration. As this increases, the myocardium
is steadily more and more impoverished; its contractile vigour
declines, and residual dilatation of the chambers sets in with
mechanical congestion of the viscera. Complaints of "the heart"
increase, the breathing becomes oppressed, the face assumes more
and more the characteristic "cardiac" appearance, and dropsy
creeps up the lower limbs. Even then the prognosis is not
hopeless, for undoubtedly a certain proportion of cases of dropsy
in old persons with degenerated heart and vessels are still amenable
to rational treatment. But the case has occasionally a more
dramatic termination. As I was able to illustrate after my second
lecture by a specimen from the Museum of Charing Cross Hospital,
a branch of one of the coronary arteries that has been narrowed by
atheroma for an indefinite length of time, with consequent cardiac
weakness and discomfort, may any moment become thrombosed
rapidly, apparently in consequence of some passing depression or
other unfavourable influence, just as in thrombosis of degenerated
cerebral vessels. Fatal angina is the result. This is a point of
great practical importance&mdash;that sudden death will occur in old
gouty subjects not from the lesion of which a basic or an apical
systolic murmur is the evidence and which causes us concern, but
from associated coronary atheroma, which we probably never
suspect; indeed, that it may occur in those subjects with no
murmur whatsoever to attract our attention and excite our fears.</p>

<p>Still more unfavourable must be the forecast in syphilitic lesions
of the heart and vessels. Of 18 of my cases in which the result
was known, only one-half improved under treatment, and 20 per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
cent. of them died within a few years (some indeed within a few
weeks) of the discovery of their disease. Cardiac failure accounts
for most of the deaths, whether developed gradually with dropsy,
which proves to be intractable; or progressing rapidly with great
cardiac distress, including angina; or occurring suddenly, as it
often does. Aneurysm makes its appearance in other instances,
of which the patient dies, or he is carried off by general paralysis
or Bright's disease.</p>

<p>What prospect have we to hold out to the man who has strained
the walls of his heart by muscular effort? I believe that one can
speak with some confidence on this subject. The middle-aged
patient who over-stretched his cardiac walls as a youth may be
comforted with the opinion that the condition is not a fatal one.
The average duration of 11 cases of this order I found to have
been 30 years when they came under my observation; the minimum
duration was nine years, the maximum 50 years. This last case
deserves particular mention. The patient was first seen by me for
failure of the heart with cardiac dropsy, consequent on fresh
breakdown after exertion during a holiday; and it is most
encouraging to observe that compensation was restored by treatment,
and that now, 12 months after that event, he is not only
alive, but able to carry on light professional work. This case also
illustrates what I have told you respecting the course of the affection,
and the prospect before the patients, in long-standing strain&mdash;that
there is continual liability to fresh embarrassment of the
heart during exertion, in which they appear to have a lasting
inclination to indulge. If they happen to follow an occupation
that entails occasional effort, or effort with excitement and worry
(if they happen, let us say, to be busy practitioners of medicine),
they suffer in the same way from attacks of tachycardia, distressing
palpitation and anxiety. Indeed, as I pointed out in my second
lecture, they are readily upset by other influences besides these,
including indigestion, to which the victim of hurry and worry
is peculiarly liable; and they must be prepared to have to lead a
life of comparative temperance and self-denial.</p>

<p>Neither is strain of the heart for the first time after 40 by any
means so grave as might be expected. Of course, sudden muscular
effort occasionally accounts for sudden death in old men. But it is
astonishing how, under such circumstances, quite old persons do
recover from conditions of extreme distress lasting acutely for half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
an hour&mdash;for instance, after running with a heavy bag to catch
a train. The majority of my patients described their condition as
improved after a time, but others relapsed; and on the whole the
correct prognosis is that they must expect to remain variously
disabled&mdash;that is, liable to præcordial distress and dyspnœa on more
than moderate exertion, or when subjected to circumstances of
other kinds that tax the heart.</p>

<p>Cardio-vascular disorder and disease referable to nervous strain
pure and simple is amenable to treatment by complete and prolonged
rest or relaxation in the majority of instances. Still, death may occur
from sudden cardiac failure; or should advice be neglected or soon
forgotten, as happens so frequently in these subjects, the attendant
high arterial tension and vascular degeneration too often end in
cerebral lesions, with or without Bright's disease. Of chronic
Bright's disease itself and the associated cardio-vascular changes in
their prognostic aspects I need not speak, except to say that along
with syphilis it is by far the most hopeless of all these affections.</p>

<p>In attempting to forecast the life of a man who is the subject of
cardio-vascular degeneration in middle or advanced life, we must
not forget the possibility of the intercurrence of acute disease.
Here is a large subject for us as practical men&mdash;one far too large
and important for discussion here: the effect, for instance, of the
existence of enlargement of the heart and an irregular and thickened
pulse on the prognosis of influenza, or, let us say, on the chances of
a successful issue after operation. Very naturally, unsound vessels
and a murmur over the præcordia weigh heavily against the
prospect of recovery from pneumonia, for example; and yet how
often do we not find a patient of 70 with one or both of these
disturbing conditions come safely through such an illness! Here,
again, I believe it is in great measure the true nature of the old-standing
disease, not the physical signs such as irregularity of pulse
or mitral bruit, that ought to be taken into account. A heart
enlarged and a radial artery thickened by prolonged activity and
nothing else will suffice to carry a man safely through an attack of
influenzal pneumonia; but what chance is there for the chronic
alcoholic under similar circumstances, or for the subject of chronic
Bright's disease?</p>

<p>So much for the general prognosis in each of these kinds of
cardio-vascular disorder and disease. But it is the particular
prognosis that we have to attempt to estimate&mdash;that is, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
prognosis in the individual patient as he comes before us and
asks us that trying question, "What is my prospect of life and
health"? We diagnose, if possible, the precise nature of his cardiac
affection, and apply to the best of our ability the conclusions which
I have just submitted to you, and at the same time we estimate as
correctly as possible the man's personal condition, character and
disposition. For, whatever may be determined with respect to the
average patient by an analysis of a large number of these cases, the
individual patient's future in disease of the heart of every kind,
degenerations included, greatly depends on the care that he takes
of himself. This introduces us to another consideration. However
earnestly we may attempt to estimate the prognosis on a strictly
rational system&mdash;that is, by basing it on an accurate and complete
diagnosis&mdash;we cannot deny that when the individual patient is
before us we are influenced directly by certain of the symptoms and
signs, without asking ourselves what their respective pathological
meaning may be. True bradycardia, the story of an unmistakable
attack of angina pectoris, a loud aortic diastolic murmur, the <em>bruit
de galop</em>&mdash;these instantly give us great concern before we have had
time to translate them into the language of morbid anatomy. Very
naturally we attempt to carry this method too far, and to reach a
prognosis, as it were, by a short cut, by attaching a prognostic value
to each clinical phenomenon&mdash;palpitation, præcordial oppression,
faintness, lethal sensations, and so on. Now, quite irrespective of
the unscientific character of this proceeding, it is of little practical
service. Even when we have listened to an account from a middle-aged
man of an attack of angina pectoris, what can we tell him of
his prospect of life until we have learned whether he be guilty
of excessive smoking or drinking, whether he be gouty, whether he
have lately strained his heart or no? What I do regard as really
valuable prognostically, in the way of a simple clinical observation,
is the determination of progressive symptoms and signs. A man
of 72 complains of oppression over the lower sternal region as often
as he climbs a hill. Twelve months later he comes and tells us that
he has had an attack of severe pain across the top of the chest
during the night. Another year passes, and he returns to say that
now he cannot hasten on the street without præcordial distress;
and it is noted that the second aortic sound, previously thick in
character, is slightly blowing. By the fourth year of observation
the patient, having had influenza in the interval, complains of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
auto-audible murmur, and of actual pain in the chest; there is now
a fully-developed aortic diastolic murmur, and his ankles swell
occasionally. Prognosis was only too easy in this case, without
inquiry into either the cause or the lesion. A few months later
true angina occurred, and very shortly the patient died, after
twenty-four hours' severe suffering.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span></h3>

<p>Not the least advantage of the etiological standpoint of our
survey of the disorders and diseases of the heart and arteries in
middle and advanced life is the rational as well as hopeful line of
treatment which it enables us to pursue. On the whole, we can
control morbific influences more easily than we can alter pathological
processes; and (what is of equal or even greater importance) a
knowledge of the causes of disease often enables us to prevent what
we could not possibly cure. For all that, the etiology of heart
disease furnishes us with but one set of many invaluable indications
for treatment. We must have also a clear mental picture of the
pathological anatomy of the conditions we would attempt to modify&mdash;for
instance, of the damage wrought by gout on the mitral valves
and aortic arch, by syphilis on the coronary arteries, by strain on
the walls of the different cardiac chambers. No less necessary is it
for the practitioner to take into account, before proceeding to
prescribe, the clinical characters and course of the case in hand.
As I have said more than once already, a large proportion of the
distress, disabilities and dangers attending degeneration of the
heart are due to some additional or extrinsic disturbance&mdash;distension
of the stomach, constipation, worry or exertion&mdash;which alone, not
the pathological condition, calls for therapeutical attention.</p>

<p>It appears, then, that the whole natural history of the diseases
and disorders of the heart&mdash;and, I might add, of every individual
case&mdash;has to be studied, and the value of its different parts absolutely
and relatively estimated, before rational treatment can be ordered.
How different will treatment be, if ordered on these principles,
from the routine procedure of prescribing a little strychnine and
digitalis for a man with oppression on exertion and a systolic bruit
at the base of his heart!</p>

<p>Let us begin this part of our subject with a brief consideration of
preventive treatment, founded on a knowledge of the cause at work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, the first thing to strike us about these unfavourable
influences is the number of them that could be avoided or controlled
successfully by simple exercise of the will. The toxic
effects of tobacco, alcohol, tea, &amp;c. are due to abuse, from thoughtlessness
or ignorance, or from indisposition rather than inability to
exercise self-control. The abuse of tobacco appears to create so
much discomfort or even alarm, of a kind which the sufferer cannot
fail to refer to its cause, that the remedy is effected automatically,
and no great harm is done. We seldom have to do more than
confirm the patient's suspicions in this direction, and recommend
temporary abstinence from the cigarette or pipe and greater care
in the future. With alcohol it is a different matter. Alcoholism
grows by what it feeds on, and our best efforts are often vain.
The present is hardly an occasion for dwelling on this subject&mdash;the
duty of the profession to their patients and friends in respect
of the abuse of alcohol. Still, I should not feel that I had discharged
to the best of my ability, or in full conformity with my
strong convictions, the duties of the honourable position which by
your favour I occupy as Lettsomian Lecturer, if I did not urge you
to exercise more fully than is at present exercised your personal
influence to discourage habitual drinking. I believe (because I have
found) that many men who are not open to arguments of an abstract
kind, can be made to pause and reconsider their manner of living
by having a concrete presentment of their condition and its results
placed before them&mdash;in plain English, by being thoroughly frightened.
"Heart disease" is a powerful argument to employ with persons of
this class, and it is one that is also justified by the issues at stake.
Of syphilis and the havoc that it works on heart, aorta and the
vascular system generally, but particularly within the nervous
system, I need not speak. The profession, as I have said, is not
yet sufficiently alive to it: what can the public be expected to do
in the way of prevention? Gout, corpulence and allied metabolic
disorders, those fruitful sources of cardio-vascular disorders and
atheroma, call for temperance not only in drinking but in eating.
Whilst the question continues to be discussed which particular
articles of food ought to be avoided by gouty individuals, let us
all join in offering them one bit of advice of the value of which
there can be no doubt: whatever they eat, to eat little. Moderation
in amount is, speaking broadly, far more important than avoidance
of the theoretical antecedents of uric acid, whether meat, or milk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
or sugar. Let me quote what Dr. George Balfour, who has written
so much and so well on disease of the heart and its treatment,
says on this subject:&mdash;"I know of no society that inculcates, by
precept or example, temperance in regard to food; yet there is
nothing ages a man or a woman so rapidly, there is nothing that
shortens life so certainly, and there is nothing that embitters the
latter days of life so much as over-indulgence in food. To those
who can afford thus to transgress&mdash;to the well-to-do&mdash;excess in
food is a much more serious menace to health and life than excess
in drink, and it is specially so in respect of senile affections of the
heart, some of which have been distinctly recognised to owe their
origin to over-indulgence, while all are distinctly aggravated by it."<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
With the observance of this simple and wholesome dietetic rule must
go attention to free elimination by all the excretory channels, and
the insurance of sufficient exercise and enjoyment of fresh air. If we
wish to impress this consideration on our own minds and give effect
to it in our practice, let us call to mind for a moment the number
of cases that I have submitted to you of atheroma of the aorta
in stout matronly women of sedentary and luxurious habits, in
whom, indeed, this degeneration is quite as common as in men.</p>

<p>I have already said so much on the subject of cardiac strain
that it is unnecessary and would be uninteresting to return to
the question of the prevention of it. We have seen how often it
occurs in the middle-aged or old subject by ill-considered attempts
at athleticism. Moderation and due respect for age are the true
guides to the useful enjoyment of exercise after 40. As for the
evil effects of nervous influences on the circulation, in addition to
anxiety, care, misfortune and grief, which are usually beyond our
control, nervous strain, as distinguished from simple hard intellectual
work, often must be relaxed if cardio-vascular damage is to be
prevented. I refer to the cases of persons in positions of great
responsibility with heavy complex prolonged duties, which they
fail to overtake without exhaustion consequent on high pressure
and excitement.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I would not have dwelt so long upon the measures calculated to
prevent degeneration of the heart, were it not that they have to be
employed with equal strictness and perseverance in the treatment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
cardio-vascular disease when it is already established and our assistance
is sought with anxiety. The etiological indications have
still to be respected faithfully; on this I need not dwell. The
next question is:&mdash;What can be done for the pathological changes
wrought on the arteries and the valves and walls of the heart? In
syphilitic lesions we do not hesitate to say that potassium iodide
should be given freely: it is a specific remedy of great value. Can
the atheromatous process be influenced with equal or with any
success? It depends on toxæmia and anæmia; the obvious indication
is to purify and enrich the blood. This, at least in respect
of gout, glycosuria and corpulence, as we have just seen, must be
effected by a thorough reform in every department of personal
hygiene. Arsenic and moderate doses of iodides, combined with an
excess of alkalis, are calculated to promote the same end. Dr. Mott
has shown that atheroma, whether of valves or of vessels, can be
traced in many instances to disease of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vasa cordis</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vasa vasorum</i>.
This carries us a step forward in our quest for indications, but the
practical conclusion remains&mdash;that the healthy nutrition of the
smaller arteries has to be restored by attention to the blood and
the use of specific remedies.</p>

<p>So much for valvular and vascular lesions. There remains to be
discussed the fulfilment of the greater indication for treatment: the
one which directs and governs the employment of the most important
and successful of all the measures comprised in cardiac therapeutics.
This is the establishment and maintenance of compensation. The
nutrition and activity of the myocardium can be increased and
sustained by means of specific cardiac stimulants and tonics, such
as strychnine, ammonia and the digitalis group of drugs; by
hæmatinics, stomachics and laxatives to afford an abundant supply
of healthy blood; by insuring wholesome nervous influences, one of
the conditions of hypertrophy; and by the employment of the non-medicinal
measures now so extensively used to increase the vigour
and benefit the metabolism of the cardiac walls, particularly active
and passive exercises and baths. This is a comprehensive statement
of the lines of treatment calculated to benefit more or less all the
kinds of cardiac degeneration which I have had occasion to notice.
Of the individual pathological changes, and the rational treatment
indicated for each from this point of view, I will refer to three only
which will serve to illustrate the considerations which ought to guide
us in practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>In the subject of regular or irregular gout attention to the cause,
that is, to disordered metabolism of the body as a whole and of the
cardiac and arterial walls in particular, promotes, as we have seen,
the recognised conditions of compensation: the etiological and
pathological indications are here practically identical. In respect of
exercise in detail, gentle walking on the level should be ordered to
begin with, that is, exercise short of producing pain or oppression.
The patient had better give up his regular work for a time, and
take advantage as fully as possible of the leisure to enjoy the
benefits of a healthy life in the fresh open air. Very shortly he
will be able to ride, play golf, shoot and cycle slowly. A course
of treatment at one of the best of our native spas or of the Continental
watering-places sometimes makes a new man of the sufferer
from gouty heart. The Nauheim treatment, whether taken there or
in England, may also do real good. But it must not be employed
indiscriminately, as is so often done. The profession ought to
remember (what the public cannot and probably never will come
to understand) that pathological diagnosis must precede rational
treatment, which consists in applying a proper remedy to the
individual case before us, not in fitting every case to a specialised
system or panacea&mdash;the essence of quackery.</p>

<p>In planning the treatment of the dilated heart of the middle-aged
man who strained his circulation in youth and comes to us complaining
of a recurrence of præcordial distress and breathlessness, we have
to remember that there is left in the cardiac walls but a portion of
that reserve of elasticity and that reserve of muscular energy which
they normally possess and require to enable them to meet the stress
of exertion. Let me remind you for a moment that, of the provisions
which the heart possesses against such an emergency or
other sudden or severe demand upon its capacity and activity, one
is extensibility of its tissues, by virtue of which it accommodates
within it the considerable increase in the charge of blood that is
poured into it from the active muscles, and the residues that accumulate
within it from insufficient discharge in the face of increased
peripheral resistance. The walls yield before the increased internal
pressure acting on them both <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a tergo</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">a fronte</i>; the heart is over-distended,
with a passing sense of discomfort, dyspnœa and lividity;
and when the muscular effort is ended the elasticity corresponding
with extensibility of the walls presently insures the return of the
chambers to their original dimensions. At the same time a second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
provision comes into operation. Increased muscular activity is
developed in accurate proportion to the rise of internal pressure and
secures sufficient output from the heart. This, I repeat, is what
occurs in the sound heart. Now, in old parietal strain extensibility
and the reserve of capacity of the chambers which it insures are
seriously exhausted; whilst the muscular function is only maintained
by means of hypertrophy, to which there is necessarily a limit. In
these cases of strain it is impossible to reduce the original dilatation&mdash;that
is permanent. But we may and ought to be able to reduce
the further dilatation, if any, that has been produced in connection
with recent failure of nutrition and fresh embarrassment. Therefore,
whilst we promote the nutrition of the elastic and muscular
structures of the myocardium on the general principles which I have
just laid down, we must be distinctly sparing of our demands on
them. Everything approaching effort must be forbidden at once and
for a sufficient time to rest and reinvigorate the cardiac tissues;
whilst the nitrites or small doses of opium will also give relief and
restore confidence in attacks of palpitation and anxiety. "Exercise,
but not exertion," will be the broad rule to follow, at any rate until
it has been proved that greater effort can be made with safety and
actual advantage. But if præcordial embarrassment be the result of
the attempt, or of ordinary professional work, as occasionally
happens, further rest will have to be taken, that is, rest for hours or
days, according to the severity of the symptoms. I have already
mentioned to you that middle-aged patients with cardiac strain,
dating from their youth, occasionally break down in their work for
months or even years. In such an event a thorough change of air
and scene should be combined with rest as a method of treatment.
A long voyage may prove invaluable, or foreign travel of an easy
and interesting kind. These not only rest the heart, but they
divert the mind and remove the curious nervousness or loss of
courage which, as I have said, is developed occasionally in these
subjects, previously so vigorous and confident.</p>

<p>Compare with this line of treatment that which is indicated in
acute cardiac strain after 40. The problem here is not how to deal
with a chronically dilated and hypertrophied heart, but with a heart
which has just yielded during effort, mainly in consequence of the
nutritional impairment of its walls. It is not simply strain of a
heart that had begun to be somewhat precariously nourished as a
natural result of age; the probability is that the heart was actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
gouty in the comprehensive sense of the term, that is, irritated by
uric acid and embarrassed by flatulence, both mechanically and
reflexly; and, indeed, possibly it was damaged by the atheromatous
process. Rest is essential at first in the treatment of this type of
case also; indeed, it is automatically secured by the distress which
accompanies attempts at movement. But rest must not be carried
too far, that is, it must not be of greater degree or duration than is
absolutely necessary as indicated by the symptoms and signs, lest it
aggravate the state of parietal mal-nutrition and promote fresh
gout. At the same time the diet must be controlled strictly or even
severely on the lines that I laid down for gout, lest the over-feeding
which accompanies rest as a matter of thoughtless routine should
have the same unfortunate effects. A course of treatment at some
of the good home or Continental spas, with special precautions, is
distinctly useful in senile strain, and the Nauheim methods have
benefited more than one case of the kind in my experience, the
degree of dilatation diminishing whilst the vigour of the heart
increased. At the same time cardiac tonics of a medicinal kind are
administered judiciously.</p>

<p>I am on the point of passing from the subject of the nutrition
of the myocardium, when it occurs to me that some of you might
very naturally ask me: What about fatty degeneration and the
treatment of it? This is a question peculiarly interesting to me.
I have not dwelt on fatty degeneration of the heart in these
lectures, and yet I have mentioned it again and again. I have
said that it is a result of alcoholism, of gouty atheroma of the
coronaries, of syphilitic arteritis in the same area, of Bright's disease,
of profound anæmia and of phosphorus poisoning; and that I
believe it may result from severe nervous strain of a harassing and
depressing character; and that in connection with each of these
causes it has to be regarded and treated differently. Nothing
could well bring home more fully to us the importance, indeed
the necessity, of pursuing in practice the line of inquiry, prognosis
and treatment which I have advocated in these lectures&mdash;the
etiological one. Let me ask you also to listen to a confession of
one of the highest authorities on heart disease in this country.
"It is absolutely impossible," says Dr. George Balfour, "to diagnosticate
fatty degeneration of the heart; we may surmise its
existence, but we can only be certain of its presence when we see it
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post mortem</i>"; and he quotes Fraentzel of Berlin in support of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
statement.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> It must have occurred to many of you, as it has
occurred to me, how seldom we diagnose fatty degeneration of the
heart until after sudden death. How can we be expected to do so
if we trust only to signs and symptoms, and overlook that which
is the key to the diagnosis&mdash;the discovery of the cause that is at
work?</p>

<p>I have now sketched very broadly the rational treatment of these
disorders and diseases as far as the object of it is to prevent the
occurrence or the extension of them, and to promote compensation
of the disabilities which they produce. It remains for me to notice,
also very briefly, the management of cardio-vascular degenerations
when the heart fails, or when it appears to fail, and distress and
danger demand more direct and immediate attention. I have said
"when the heart appears to fail" of set purpose. I am anxious to
direct your attention, if it be but for a moment, to the fact that in
many instances where præcordial oppression, pain, palpitation and
faintness, with frequent small irregular pulse, are significant of
serious disturbance of the action of the heart, there is no failure
of the myocardium in the proper sense of the term, but only
embarrassment of a temporary character. Do not conclude from
this that I regard the disturbance of the heart as of little account.
I have called it serious, for indeed the patient may perish of it.
What I wish to maintain is that in cardiac degeneration of any
kind, in chronic cardiac dilatation, and in the enlarged heart of
Bright's disease and of emphysema, just as in ordinary valvular
disease, attacks of distress, alarming both to patient and doctor,
often occur which call for nothing more in the way of treatment
than attention to some intercurrent influence&mdash;an indigestible meal,
loaded bowels, a nervous shock, a thoughtless effort, a passing hardship
or nervous strain. Digitalis and its allies, strychnine, alcohol,
nitrites, iodides and the rest are out of place in such an event.
Complete rest in bed, a carminative draught, calomel and saline
purgatives, spare and highly digestible diet, reassurance and a little
time are quite sufficient means of treatment.</p>

<p>When true failure occurs, manifested by the familiar phenomena
of residual dilatation of the heart, mechanical congestion and dropsy,
a different set of measures are demanded. Now is the time to
attend with expedition, energy and completeness to the fulfilment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
of the three great therapeutical indications for the treatment of
cardiac failure: to reduce the peripheral resistance; to increase the
vigour of ventricular contraction and rehabilitate hypertrophy;
and to remove arrears of work in the form of residual blood in the
cardiac chambers, mechanical congestion of the veins and viscera,
and dropsy of the integuments and serous sacs. Bodily rest; a
light, solid diet, and a definite allowance of alcohol, if required;
active purgation with mercurials, salines and jalap; and the exhibition
of sufficiently large doses of digitalis or one of its congeners,
in combination with saline and other diuretics&mdash;these are the means
calculated to attain the desired objects. You will not expect me
to enter into the many details of the management of cardiac
failure. It is not different in any important respect in the man
of middle or advanced age with cardiac degeneration from what it
is in an ordinary case of chronic valvular disease. Only on a few
points do I desire to dwell. First, that we must not be afraid to
purge these patients, if necessary, every morning. Secondly, that
when the appetite flags and flatulence occurs, instead of slops a blue
pill or a dose of calomel should be given, and light solids persevered
with. Third, that digitalis must be given freely, the dose of the
tincture, for instance, being raised to 15 or even 20 minims every
four hours, if smaller doses, such as 7½ or 10 minims, fail.
Unquestionably there is a disposition on the part of some practitioners
to pause or retrace their steps in the dosage of this
invaluable drug, alarmed by the irregularity, frequency and smallness
of the pulse. All these characters of the pulse call for more
digitalis, not for less. In this connection let me also say that the
most ready and accurate, because measurable, evidence of the action
of digitalis in cardiac failure is strangely disregarded in ordinary
practice&mdash;I mean the volume of the renal secretion. We may be in
difficulty, and we may differ with each other, as to the tension of
the patient's pulse and the use of continuing or modifying the
digitalis treatment, when all that we have to do is to ascertain the
exact degree of diuresis. Fourth, that nocturnal restlessness and
sleeplessness are to be met unhesitatingly with permission to spend
the night in an easy chair by the bedside. Fifth, that, according
to my experience, acupuncture and drainage succeed perfectly in
these senile cases with dropsy, as much as 10 pints or more of
serum escaping in the course of 24 hours, to the complete and often
lasting relief of the circulation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>And now I must bring these lectures to a close. In doing so
I feel that I have not only to thank you, Sir, and the Fellows of
the Medical Society and our visitors for the favour with which
I have been received and the patience with which you have listened
to me, but at the same time to apologise for the many defects, both
in matter and in form, of what I have presented to you. It is
a fortunate circumstance for me that, whilst the subject was so
large and so difficult, the mode of treatment of it commonly
associated with the Lettsomian Lectures and your kind forbearance
have enabled me to conceal my shortcomings by free selection of
less severely scientific topics, and the employment of an easy style.
At the same time, may I claim a little of your favourable consideration
for the aspect in which I have regarded the disorders and
diseases of the heart and arteries in middle and advanced life?
I should be satisfied with the results of my efforts on this occasion,
whatever may be thought of their form, if I have succeeded in
convincing you of the practical advantage of regarding these
complaints from the side of their causes as well as of their
pathological anatomy.</p>
